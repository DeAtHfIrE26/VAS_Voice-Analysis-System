Based on the provided project description, I'll create a comprehensive prompt for the Replit agent to develop a cognitive impairment detection system through voice analysis.

The project requires building a proof-of-concept pipeline that analyzes voice data to detect early signs of cognitive decline using NLP and audio feature extraction techniques. The system needs to process audio samples, extract relevant linguistic and acoustic features, and apply machine learning to identify potential cognitive impairment markers.

## Prompt for Replit Agent

```
Create a comprehensive Python-based system for MemoTag's speech intelligence module that detects cognitive stress or decline indicators from voice data. Follow these detailed instructions:

1. PROJECT STRUCTURE:
   - Create a modular Python project with clear separation of concerns
   - Implement the following components:
     * Audio preprocessing module
     * Speech-to-text conversion
     * Feature extraction engine
     * Machine learning analysis pipeline
     * Visualization and reporting tools
     * (Optional) API endpoint for risk scoring

2. AUDIO PREPROCESSING:
   - Implement functions to:
     * Load and normalize audio files (support WAV, MP3, FLAC formats)
     * Apply noise reduction and signal enhancement
     * Segment audio into analyzable chunks (sentences/utterances)
     * Extract raw audio features (amplitude, frequency, spectral properties)
   - Use libraries like librosa, scipy, and pydub

3. SPEECH-TO-TEXT:
   - Implement speech recognition using advanced models
   - Support both offline processing (vosk/whisper) and online APIs (Google/Azure)
   - Preserve timestamp information for each word
   - Retain hesitation markers, fillers, and pauses in transcription
   - Include confidence scores for recognized words

4. FEATURE EXTRACTION (Critical Component):
   - Linguistic Features:
     * Hesitation markers frequency ("um", "uh", etc.)
     * Word recall issues (detect word substitutions using semantic analysis)
     * Vocabulary richness metrics (type-token ratio, lexical diversity)
     * Syntactic complexity measures
     * Word frequency analysis (compare against age-appropriate norms)
     * Part-of-speech patterns
   
   - Acoustic Features:
     * Pause analysis (duration, frequency, distribution within sentences)
     * Speech rate calculation (words per minute, syllable rate)
     * Pitch variability and prosody patterns
     * Voice quality metrics (jitter, shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio)
     * Energy/amplitude patterns
     * Articulation precision measures
   
   - Temporal Features:
     * Response latency for questions or prompts
     * Word retrieval timing patterns
     * Speaking turn duration analysis

5. MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE:
   - Implement multiple unsupervised approaches:
     * Clustering algorithms (K-means, hierarchical clustering)
     * Anomaly detection (isolation forests, one-class SVM)
     * Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) for visualization
     * Feature importance analysis
   - Design interpretable models that explain which features contribute to risk scores
   - Include feature normalization and standardization techniques
   - Implement cross-validation where applicable

6. VISUALIZATION & REPORTING:
   - Create interactive visualizations for:
     * Feature distributions across samples
     * Anomaly detection results
     * Feature correlation matrices
     * Cluster analysis results
   - Generate comprehensive HTML reports with insights
   - Include summary statistics and potential biomarkers identified

7. OPTIONAL API COMPONENT:
   - Implement a Flask/FastAPI endpoint that:
     * Accepts audio file uploads
     * Processes them through the pipeline
     * Returns risk scores with confidence intervals
     * Provides feature-specific breakdowns of results

8. DATA HANDLING:
   - Include functions to simulate/generate realistic cognitive impairment speech patterns
   - Implement proper data validation and error handling
   - Ensure privacy considerations for audio data

9. DOCUMENTATION & TESTING:
   - Add comprehensive docstrings for all functions
   - Create a README.md with setup instructions and usage examples
   - Implement unit tests for critical components
   - Include performance metrics and evaluation

10. FUTURE EXPANSION:
    - Add comments suggesting potential improvements
    - Design the system to be extendable for additional features
    - Include guidelines for retraining with new data

Create this system ensuring high code quality, efficient processing, and robust error handling. The final system should be able to process a set of audio files and generate a comprehensive analysis report highlighting potential cognitive decline indicators.
```

## Key Implementation Considerations

For this project to be successful, the Replit agent should focus on several critical aspects:

**Audio Processing Libraries:**
- Librosa for advanced audio feature extraction
- Pydub for audio manipulation and format handling
- PyAudio for real-time audio processing if needed[1]

**Speech Recognition:**
- OpenAI Whisper for high-accuracy transcription
- Vosk for offline processing capabilities
- Timestamps for each word to analyze pauses accurately[1]

**Feature Extraction:**
- NLTK and spaCy for linguistic analysis
- Praat or parselmouth for detailed acoustic measurements
- Custom algorithms for temporal patterns specific to cognitive assessment[1]

**Machine Learning Framework:**
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML algorithms
- PyTorch or TensorFlow for any deep learning components
- Interpretation tools like SHAP or LIME for explainability[1]

**Visualization and Reporting:**
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Customized HTML report generation with summary statistics[1]

The solution should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future integration of more advanced features and clinical validation workflows.
